          History and Tradition
          <p>
            The Hospital was founded in 1780 by Lady Hartstonge and other benefactors as a Fever and Lock Hospital. It treated epidemics during the Great Famine (1845-1847). The Hospital fell into disrepair during the 1850’s to the 1880’s. In 1888 the then Bishop of Limerick, Bishop Edward Thomas O’Dwyer invited the Nursing Sisters of the Little Company of Mary to the Hospital.AAH_Sbitar's was the first site in Ireland where the Little Company of Mary Nursing Sisters came to work. Since then, on-going refurbishment and development has continued to take place. With the closure of Barrington’s Hospital in 1988,AAH_Sbitar's expanded its role, particularly in relation to Accident & Emergency. There has been continuous development since then.

           AAH_Sbitar's Hospital is a Smoke Free Campus<br />
    
            Patients, staff and visitors are not permitted to smoke in the hospital buildings or on the hospital grounds</h3>
          <p><br />
            Under the Public Health Tobacco Amendment Bill governing smoking in the workplace, smoking is strictly prohibited in all hospital buildings.
            <br />
            As a member of the Health Promoting Hospitals Network, AAH_Sbitar's Hospital promotes a completely smoke-free environment throughout the entire hospital and grounds. The hospital has a duty to provide a healthy environment and a safe place for patients to be treated.
          </p>
          What we ask of patients who smoke:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not smoke while you are in hospital</li>
              <li>Do not bring cigarettes into the hospital</li>
              <li>Please support our efforts to create a healthy smoke free environment for all who come to the hospital</li>
            </ul>
            Smoking cessation counselling/therapy is available and any patient who wishes to avail of this service should inform the Senior Nurse on duty.
          </p>
          Patients who leave the hospital grounds to smoke do so at their own risk
